# **Internship Rules** 

# **1\. Zero Tolerance Policy on Copy Paste of Code**

❌ Direct copy pasting from GenAI (ChatGPT, AI Agent, etc.) is strictly forbidden.  
 If discovered, the internship will be terminated immediately.  
 All work must be originally written by the intern.

---

## **2\. AI as a Guide, Not a Writer**

* Interns may use AI to:

  * Ask for **concept explanations**

  * Get **debugging hints** or alternative approaches

  * Learn about **best practices**

* AI **must never** be used to generate final deliverables.

* Any AI usage must be followed by **manual re implementation in your own words/code**.

---

## **3\. Proof of Understanding**

* Interns must be able to:

  * **Explain their code logic line by line**

  * Answer conceptual questions without AI help

  * Modify their own code live during evaluations

* If you cannot explain your code → it will be treated as copied work.

---

## **4\. Code Quality Standards**

* Ensure **accessibility (a11y)**, performance, and responsive design.

* Always test before submission.

---

## **5\. Ethical Practices**

* Never use AI or online forums to fetch a finished project.

* Respect **teamwork & honesty**: collaborate, but never outsource.

---

## **6\. Evaluations & Accountability**

* During evaluation:

  * You will be asked to **walk through your project live**.

  * You must demonstrate **real time coding ability**.

  * Random checks will be done for **AI written code patterns**.

* If flagged → internship ends immediately.

---


## **7\. Deployment & Documentation**

* Use approved platforms (**Vercel/Cloudflare**).

* Maintain **README.md** explaining your project setup.

* Keep **Git commits clean** with meaningful messages.

---

## **Final Rule: Learn, Don’t Cheat**

This internship is about **becoming a real engineer**.

* **Do not copy.**

* **Do not outsource.**

* **Do not paste from AI.**

Use AI only to **learn and grow** , not to replace your effort.

**Violation \= Instant Termination**
